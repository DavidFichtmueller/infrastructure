Bob: test schema and documents with newest version of Xerces. Develop a suite data documents, that should remain valid, even if a problem in the schema that has not yet been detected,should remain valid
SDD should specify parser for which standard has been validated -> Apache Xerces, newest version. Testing with SAX and DOM.

Chuck Miller use cases: Mostly presentation of unstructured descriptions -> SDD is not necessary for this, xhtml with DublinCore or RDF header would be sufficient.

Steve Wilkinson: Use case network of computer unskilled  workers, exchange often using Excel, low end of Access.

Martin Pullan: Develop specific terminology sets for specific taxonomic groups, establish those as standards.

Jessie reports on plantontology, SDD has no current relations. Problem of ontologies currently defined for individual genetically important plants, not cross-cutting.

Martin Pullan: Improving terminology definition, problem with categorical data: adding categories changes semantics of previous data.

Alexander Ryss: Describing nematodes, description may be noisy because they describe multiple species.
Noise in data for other reasons as well.

SDD enables social contracts about sharing terminology to be expressed.

Discussion Polymorphism methods in schema:

xsi-type method:
Characters
  Character xsi:type=CategoricalCharacter
  Character xsi:type=QuantitativeCharacter
-> invalid

Characters
  Character 
    Representation ...
-> invalid because abstract type


Elementname/choice method:
Characters
  CategoricalCharacter
  QuantitativeCharacter


Choice/Elementname method for reference or direct nesting:
----------------------------------------------------------
DirektLabel :     PublicationSimple label="Hagedorn, Personia 78 (1998)"
Crossreference    PublicationRef   ref="123"
GUID/URI          PublicationHRef  ref="http://sldkfjslkd" label="Hagedorn, Personia 78 (1998)"
Nested:           Publication 
                      Representation
                          Label lang=en  text=Hagedorn, Personia 78 (1998)
                      PublicationYear=1998

xsi:Polymorphism method
----------------------------------------------------------
DirektLabel :     Publication xsi:type="PublicationSimple" label="Hagedorn, Personia 78 (1998)"
Crossreference    Publication xsi:type="PublicationRef"   ref="123"
GUID/URI          Publication xsi:type="PublicationHRef"  ref="http://sldkfjslkd" label="Hagedorn, Personia 78 (1998)"
Nested:           Publication xsi:type="PublicationDef" (with complex content defining the object)

Roger Hyam proposed an all-optional model, where the different types are merged:

Publication ref="123" reftype="internal" label="Hagedorn, Personia 78 (1998)"
   Content (nested as well)

Alternating requiredness is not enforceable in xml-schema, so 
<Publication /> would be a valid

Would be inconsistent, but would not be picked by schema validation (no keyref identity constraints possible on optional attributes).

<Publication label="null"\> is not preventable, but obvious when any quality control exists.

General cross-cutting questions:
---------------------------------

Use xsi:polymorphism or choice method (with social contract being derived from base type)?

Which referencing pattern?

How to distinguish between simple stub and multiple complex object class definition
  SpecimenDarwinCore1
  SpecimenABCD
or, in contrast to the choice polymorphism method here by namespace/xs:any? Name of container element?

Pattern for verbatim/original, unconstrained text, constrained value
 Example: Rank, date
  
Perhaps change Publication to PublicationReference, to free name for online-publications proper?

Comment to Stan/John: JulianDay better DayOfYear

DONE:
Clean up measurement unit stuff. Ability to define both at character definition and at data level, both either as reference to defined objects
and simple text makes it difficult to verify that data within a character remain comparable.

Problem of concersion and compatibility. Most unit non-convertible. 
Possible solution: MeasurementUnitSet/MeasurementUnit/ConversionRules
External quality check, whether measurements units are defined and those used in a single character all have conversion data associated with them.

Instead: now measurement unit only in Character definition, summary and sample data may only override unit prefix, and this
only if a default prefix has been defined (if not unit may already contain a prefix, or scientific prefixes may not be appropriate
(µinch...).

------------

Taxon hierarchy:
Rather type enumeration:
  Phylogenetic
  Taxonomic
  ArbitrarySubsets



DO MeasurementUnitPrefixEnum

Ask SDD, also Arthur Chapman
 MediaResource
   or 
 AudioVisual
?




Small multimedia resource to be displayed in addition to the label. It should be quicly recognized and will usually not be informative enough to base decisions on it alone. Example: in a concept tree a leaf icon image is provided for the node containing leaf characters.
A set of representative multimedia resources that convey the meaning even when used without a Text representation (but applications may choose to combine text and media). Example: display shape images to select a state during identification. If more than one resource is defined here, the assumption is that they will normally all be consumed before making a selection.

The size of the resource should be sufficiently concise to view ca. 6 images from different labels concurrently on the intended output device, or listened to ca. 6 audio extracts before making a selection. - Both Icon and these selectors resources are language/audience-specific (e. g., image with abbreviation, bird-call with spoken text).






ICON: Small multimedia resource to be displayed in addition to the label. It should be quicly recognized and will usually not be informative enough to base decisions on it alone. Example: in a concept tree a leaf icon image is provided for the node containing leaf characters.

SELECTOR: A set of representative multimedia resources that convey the meaning even when used without a Text representation (but applications may choose to combine text and media). Example: display shape images to select a state during identification. If more than one resource is defined here, the assumption is that they will normally all be consumed before making a selection.

(Hint: Choice is  
equivalent to 
polymorphism,
derived from same
base type.)

SequenceCharacter has not yet properly been introduced into points of polymorphism.


Element StateReference derived from this has manual id and debugkey - clear, because 
 extended from Type ConceptStateRef, multiple inheritance.

Ask Task group mailing list:
 is element id for local cross references confusing, if (as in TCS and SDD) required to be unique only within an object type (but not
necessarily among all xml-elements in a document)?


Change content metadata to be based on Abstract object again

Is Technical metadata always the same for all datasets in a datasets element?

Proposal: change TechnicalMetadata to ProviderMetadata, ProvisionMetadata, ProcessMetadata
Metadata changed to ContentMetadata, 




PROPOSAL DC: change JulianDay to DayOfYear. Check ISO-Date issue, this is not an xml-type but must be constructed manually based on string.

Bob, Jacob, Pierre Grard(?), Bryan, Gregor

FRIDAY SESSION

AGENDA

Kevin/Jacob Check taxon subsets, type class hierarchy

------------

BRYAN check image support - role enumeration when Bryan.

Kevin: (global) Concept states

Bob: unnatural requ. in concept trees character only at terminal nodes.
  All agreed change to DA graph
  GH: need to do some cleanup in concepts

Semantic overload of concept trees
if so, perhaps rather as node list?
i.e. Concept, ConceptRelation?

Are specializations always values for generalization?
Do we need to separate concept states, or may they be simply concept nodes?

Dependency: check issue of default dependency against thesis

Bob/Jacob: Related taxa issues


Kevin: Text characters
Perhaps (Bob) rather separate element name, rather than overloading state?
One difference: sequence can not be defined. I believe in combination with states, text as last always ok.
Other: probably not meaningful to occur in multiple. Use cases? I had only Bob's states in mind.
How to better see the text states?
Perhaps Character type text, constrained to have only this element?


123 something real like shape: "circular" 
    UnconstrainedText=false
121 unconstrained text
    UnconstrainedText=true

NEW Categorical with extension
<CategoricalWithTextChar ref="99">
 <State ref="state123"><Notes>in species xxx this may be difficult to observe.</Notes></State>
 <Text>banana-shaped</Text>
</Char>

NEW Separate text-only character
<TextChar ref="99">
 <Text>blue, banana-shaped, found in Mexico</Text>
</Char>

Think about ConceptTree/Specification/Type. Rather Composition, Generalization, or the other purposes and move that to the edges???

TaxonHierarchyTypeEnum introduced, the previous IsPhylogenetic true/false was insufficient, not capturing non-phylogenetic taxonomy versus pure filtering.

------------

Remove part/kind from ConceptHierarchyType
add annotation to relation


Rename MediaResource Role to MediaResourceRichRef
Where is MediaResources still used?

Make Dataset itself derived from Abstract Object? DONE

Add 
iconic (not icon), primary, secondary to ResourceRoleEnum

Add decimal places, in sample/summary data, significant to significantfigures?

Major changes in SDD at the St. Petersburg meeting:

All object types are derived from abstract base type. ExternalDataInterface grouping given up, all object types, including SDD ones treated symmetrically.
Multilingual representation was simplified (one level of nesting less than previous version). The text character facility was redesigned to be expressed
differently in xml, the previous solution was considered unintuitive. This involves element name and structural changes, but no essential changes
in functionality. The expression of measurement units was simplified, rather than allowing multiple units within a character (which required 
structures to define units and their conversion methods), only onee unit may be defined, which may be accompanied with different scientific prefix
letters (k, c, m, µ) in different descriptions.

MediaResource needs xml:lang and audience, optional, but not translation!

TODO: check constraints in UBIF_RootIdentityConstraints.xsd for correctness. Perhaps rename to DatasetsRoot.xsd
Perhaps this may now be given up, and can be included in SDD itself.

TODO: on language group in UBIF types: ###COMMENT needs updating, see wiki!### Defines a required 'xml:lang' attribute (recommended special values are: 'x-unknown', 'x-neutral', 'x-mixed')

FIX and finalize decision about lang/audience in dataset root.

CHANGE annotation to attribute??? on object itsel rather than part of developer tool group?
