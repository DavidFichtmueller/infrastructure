* Desactive wikis until used
* Add the standard website next to the description if present: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/

## README

* Start with the title of the standard
* Add an abstract
* Indicate the permanent URL of the standard: http://www.tdwg.org/standards/450
* Included a preferred citation for the standard (as blockquote), including the name, authors and permanent URL

## Management

* Create a [team to manage the standard](https://github.com/orgs/tdwg/teams)
* Give the team the same name as the repo if possible, but mixed case: `DwC`
* Add a description for the team: `Darwin Core contributors``
* Invite at least one person to the team.

## Content

* Archive old content as a [release](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/releases)
