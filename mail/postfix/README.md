# Postfix Configuration

Email is accepted on two names: tdwg.org and lists.tdwg.org.

`lists.tdwg.org` mail is forwarded to Mailman.

`tdwg.org` is for aliases, for the executive committee and so on.

Mail is accepted from anywhere for the mailing lists, but only via the [spam blocker](http://mxguarddog.com/) service for the aliases.
